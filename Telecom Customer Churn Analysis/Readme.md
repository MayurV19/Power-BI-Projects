## Introduction 🌐

Ever heard of the **"Silent Exodus"** in business? It's called *Customer Churn*, and it refers to the percentage of customers who discontinue using a company's products or services within a specific timeframe. Understanding and managing churn is pivotal for a company's sustainable growth, right alongside *customer acquisition rate*.

*Customer acquisition* and *churn*—two sides of the growth coin. While acquisition brings in fresh customers, churn reflects those who slipped away. It's a delicate balance: too much focus on acquisition won't guarantee offsetting churn's drain, and concentrating solely on retention hampers company expansion.

## Background 🚀

In this case study, let's dive into *Databel*, a fictional telecom company facing a spike in customer churn. Databel is on a mission to unveil the factors driving churn, with the goal of implementing strategic interventions to secure customer loyalty.

In the competitive telecom industry of the US, the annual churn rate fluctuates between 21% and 49%, reaching a recorded 31% in 2021.

Before we embark on any analysis, let's identify potential causes for this high churn rate. 🚀

## Business Problem and Understanding 📈

In our recent observations, we noted that **Databel** is currently facing a slightly elevated churn rate of approximately 27%, closely aligned with the recorded rate of 31% in 2021. However, we recognize that there are ample opportunities to address churn proactively, subsequently enhancing the company’s overall revenue and profitability.
