## Recap üîô 

**AtliQ Hardware**, a subsidiary of AtliQ Inc., is a company that sells computer hardware products;  printers, laptops, mouses, monitors, peripherals,accessories, storage devices etc. The company sells its products to customers (retailers and distributors) who then go on to sell them to the end-consumer. It also operates its own exclusive stores, _AtliQ Hardware Exclusive_ (brick & mortar), and _AtliQ Hardware e-store_ (online platform).

As the company continues to grow consistently, there has been an explosion in the volume and velocity of data. The company as such is finding it difficult to operate with as time goes by. As a result, the need for an analytical solution that would aid in company operations and data-driven decision-making is being voiced across the company. The proposed solution is to help the various departments/teams at AtliQ (finance, sales, marketing, supply chain and executive) operate efficiently and effectively.

## Current Project Details ‚úî

### üåü Situation:
AtliQ Hardware, a provider of computer hardware, faced challenges in efficiently managing operations across new markets, particularly in Latin America. With the goal of expanding market share and maximizing profitability, the company recognized the need for a data-driven approach to decision-making and operations.

### üåü Task:
The task at hand was to develop an enterprise-level analytical solution that would empower various departments within the company, including Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain, to perform their duties seamlessly in an effective manner. This solution should be able to provide comprehensive insights into company financials, market dynamics, product performance, and operational efficiency among other things.

### üåü Action:
Leveraging the capabilities of Power BI, I embarked on building a sophisticated analytical platform. This involved utilizing advanced features such as dynamic reporting, advanced DAX queries, advanced analytics (tooltips, bookmarks etc.) and meaningful visualizations to extract and present actionable insights from the company's data.

### üåü Result:
The implementation of this analytical solution can potentially result in significant improvements for AtliQ Hardware. With enhanced visibility into key metrics and performance indicators, the company was able to achieve profitability gains and make data-driven decisions to capture market share in both established and emerging markets. The success of this project not only elevated the company's analytical capabilities but also positioned it for sustained growth and success in the competitive landscape of consumer electronics.
